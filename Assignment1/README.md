## Git Repository

```bash
https://github.com/ghadesi/LOG8415---Advanced-Concepts-in-Cloud-Computing.git
```

## How to run

There is a detailed section in the report file on how to run the program but essentially you can do it two ways. First,  you need to go configure your AWS credentials in the "credentials" file which is in the "Assignment 1" folder of the git repository.

1- [bonus] Please, run the below command (the shell script will build the docker and run all scripts inside the docker):
```python
source script.sh
```
Make sure the script.sh is in Assignment 1 folder, which contains file necessary to build docker and run

2- Simply run main.py in Assignment 1 folder of the repository if you don't wanna go through the docker building etc...
```python
python main.py or python3 main.py
```
Again, make sure you are in Assignment 1 folder.
